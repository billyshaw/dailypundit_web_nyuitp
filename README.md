This is the source code for the first web prototype of The Daily Pundit, a project started at the NYU Tisch Interactive Telecommunications Program (ITP)

A live version is viewable at http://thedailypundit.com

The Daily Pundit is a Q&A-driven news platform & app designed for you to ask, answer, & track questions on the most
important daily news stories. Currently, The Daily Pundit is a web app prototype (http://thedailypundit.com), where we publish 5 of
the most important stories everyday. Upon reading these synopses, a user can ask, track, or answer a questions story. 

Our web interface vaguely emulates “cards,” bringing a clean, paper-like feel to the product. We designed the prototype website to have online editorial visual cues above the fold, and social network visual cues beneath the fold.

In the future, however, Daily Pundit native iOS app will be our primary focus; it has been fully designed and is awaiting development. Everyday, a new set of story cards appears on your dashboard with a headline, accompanied by a corresponding vertical icon. Tapping one of these cards opens a paginated topic synopsis in the following order, with two to three sentences under each: “What You Need to Know,” “Why It Matters,” & “How it Affects You.”

- As a social Q&A site, preventing spams and trolls is one of our biggest concerns. The first layer of protection against troll is through only allowing users to sign up through social media
- Social media authentication uses HybridAuth (https://github.com/hybridauth/hybridauth)
